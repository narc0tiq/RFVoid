**RFVoid** is a [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) mod using
the RF API providing a block that consumes infinite RF.


## Compiling ##

To compile this mod, you will need a working MCP + Forge +
[MCPDeobfuscate](https://github.com/FunnyMan3595/mcp_deobfuscate) install with
[MCPInterface](https://github.com/FunnyMan3595/mcp_interface) plugged in.
Instructions for that are in the README.txt files provided in the projects.

You will also need to provide CoFHCore, either as a library or as a
project dependency. The former is probably easier.


## Jenkins Builds ##

TBD.
